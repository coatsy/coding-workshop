## Timer

Add a countdown timer to make it a bit harder to finish the maze.

> **Hint** use the game object and start a timer

## Bonus objects

Add some additional objects to the maze that might do things like

* Increase the score
* Make the ball bigger (or smaller)
* Speed up or slow down the rate at which the ball moves

## Increase difficulty as the score goes up

You could:

* Make the ball go faster
* Change the size of the ball

## Display images on the micro:bit screen

Maybe display an image using the micro:bit LEDs when you:

* Finish a level; or
* Bump into a wall

## Add a moment's grace after starting a level

Give the player a moment to have a look at the maze when starting a level so they don't justm bang into a wall and lose points straight away.

## Make the micro:bit into a steering wheel

Change the direction of the ball based on the rotation of the micro:bit and use the butttons as an accellerator and a brake

## Add more backgrounds/mazes

The background mazes used in the project you remixed were generated using an online maze generator. You could make some more. Instructions for making new mazes are [here](.\maze-images\README.md).
