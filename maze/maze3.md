Now you've seen how to change the controls to a different key combination, it's time to see how you can add a new input device entirely. In this case we're going to use the [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.org/)

From their website:

> micro:bit is a tiny programmable computer, designed to make learning and teaching easy and fun!

The picture above (taken from the [micro:bit features page](https://www.microbit.org/guide/features/)) shows the large number of sensors, inputs and outputs on this little board. The ones you'll be using are:

* [accelerometer](https://www.microbit.org/guide/features/#accel) (to find out which way the board is tilting)
* [LED lights](https://www.microbit.org/guide/features/#leds) (to show a message when you hit a wall or finish a level)
* [button A](https://www.microbit.org/guide/features/#buttons) (to act as a brake)
* [USB connector](https://www.microbit.org/guide/features/#usb) (to power the board)
* radio and [Bluetooth](https://www.microbit.org/guide/features/#bluetooth) antenna (to communicate to your game)
