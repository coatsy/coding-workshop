Here are some suggestions for making the game more interesting

* Add a background
* Change where the pipes appear
* Keep score
* Get faster as the game goes on
* Make the bird face in the direction it's going
* Add power-ups

There's a sample of the game with all of these enhancements done at [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/336349459](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/336349459)
