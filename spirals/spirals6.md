Here are some more spirals created using just the code you've already written, just with a few of the values changed. See if you can reproduce them.

![Repeat = 400, Change counter by 0.5](./images/challenge-1.png)

![Repeat = 200, Turn 72 degrees](./images/challenge-2.png)

![Repeat = 400, Change counter by 0.4, Turn 59 degrees, Change pen colour by 0.25](./images/challenge-3.png)

![Repeat = 800, Change pen colour by 0.125, Change counter by 0.25, Turn 119 degrees](./images/challenge-4.png)

See if you can work out how to make regular-sided figures or to add extra colours.

You can play with a number of these parameters in the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/303918558/" target="_blank">Spiral Playground</a>. Click See Inside to change the values. Press the s key to create a spiral.
